pretty=true) or JSON.json(x; pretty=4) to control pretty printing\nCan pass filename as first argument to write JSON directly to a file JSON.json(file, x) the file name is returned\nCan pass any IO as 1st argument to write JSON to it: JSON.json(io, x)\nCircular reference tracking is fixed/improved (previously peer references were written as null)\nExplicit keyword arguments to control a number of serialization features, including:\nomit_null::Bool whether nothing/missing Julia values should be skipped when serializing\nomit_empty::Bool whether empty Julia collection values should be skipped when serializing\nallownan::Bool similar to the parsing keyword argument to allow/disallow writing of invalid JSON values NaN, -Inf, and Inf\nninf::String the string to write if allownan=true and serializing -Inf\ninf::String the string to write if allownan=true and serializing Inf\nnan::String the string to write if allownan=true and serializing NaN\njsonlines::String when serializing an array, write each element independently on a new line as an implicit array; can be read back when parsing by also passing jsonlines=true\ninline_limit::Int threshold number of elements in an array under which an array should be printed on a single line (only applicable when pretty printing)\nfloat_style::Symbol allowed values are :shortest, :fixed, and :exp corresponding to printf format styles, %g, %f, and %e, respectively\nfloat_precision::Int number of decimal places to use when printing floats\nWhy the changes:\nMostly just modernizing the interfaces (use of keyword arguments vs. positional)\nUtilizing multiple dispatch to combine JSON.print and JSON.json and provide convenience for writing to files\nMost opened issues over the last few years were about providing more controls around writing JSON without having to completely implement a custom serializer\nMore consistency with JSON.parse keyword args with allownan and jsonlines\nJSON.print\nWhat stayed the same:\nTechnically still defined for backwards compatibility, but just calls JSON.json under the hood\nWhy the changes:\nNot necessary as all the functionality can be combined without ambiguity or overlap with JSON.json\nJSON.lower\nWhat stayed the same:\nStill used to transform Julia values into JSON-appropriate values\nWhat changed:\nlower technically now lives in the StructUtils.jl package (though overloading in JSON is fine)\nCan overload for a specific \"style\" for non-owned types, like struct MyStyle <: JSON.JSONStyle end, then JSON.lower(::MyStyle, x::Rational) = (den=x.den, num=x.num), then have the style used when writing like JSON.json(1//3; style=MyStyle())\nProbably don't need to lower except in rare cases; there are default lower defintions for common types and most structs/AbstractDict/AbstractArray will work out of the box; lower is mostly useful when wanting to have the JSON output of a struct be a string or a number, for example, so going between aggregate/non-aggregate from Julia to JSON\nWhy the changes:\nAlong with the new corresponding lift interface, the lower + lift combination is a powerful generalization of doing \"domain transformations\"\nJSON.StructuralContext / JSON.show_json / JSON.Serialization\nWhat stayed the same:\nThese have been removed in favor of simpler interfaces and custom JSONStyle subtypes + overloads\nWhy the changes:\nThe use of distinct contexts for different writing styles (pretty, compact) is unnecessary and led to code duplication\nThere was often confusion about whether a custom Serialization or StructuralContext was needed and what intefaces were then required to implement\nThe need to customize separators, delimiters, and indentation, while powerful, can be accomplished much simpler via keyword arguments or is not necessary at all (i.e. JSON.jl shouldn't be too concerned with how to produce anything that isn't JSON)\nInstead of overloading showstring/showelement/showkey/showpair/showjson, lower can be used to accomplish any requirements of \"overloading\" how values are serialized; the addition of \"styles\" also allows customizing for non-owned types instead of needing a custom context + `showjson` method\nJSONText\nWhat changed:\nNothing; JSONText can still be used to have a JSON-formatted string be written as-is when serializing","category":"page"},{"location":"migrate/#Reading-JSON","page":"Migration guides","title":"Reading JSON","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"migrate/","page":"Migration guides","title":"Migration guides","text":"JSON.parse / JSON.parsefile\nWhat stayed the same:\nThese functions take the same JSON input arguments (String, IO, or filename for parsefile)\nThe dicttype, allownan, and null keyword arguments all remain and implement the same functionality\nWhat changed:\nJSON.Object{String, Any} is now the default type used when parsing instead of Dict{String, Any}; JSON.Object is a drop-in replacement for Dict, supporting the AbstractDict interface, mutation, dot-access (getproperty) to keys, memory and performance benefits for small objects vs. Dict, and preserves the JSON order of keys. For large objects (hundreds or thousands of keys), or to otherwise restore the pre-1.0 behavior, you can do JSON.parse(json; dicttype=Dict{String, Any}).\nThe inttype keyword argument has been removed\nThe allownan keyword argument now defaults to false instead of true to provide a more accurate JSON specification behavior as the default\nThe use_mmap keyword argument has been removed from parsefile; mmapping will now be decided automatically by the package and any mmaps used for parsing will be completely finalized when parsing has finished\nNumbers in JSON will now be parsed as Int64, BigInt, Float64, or BigFloat, instead of only Int64 or Float64. Many JSON libraries support arbitrary precision ints/floats, and now JSON.jl does too.\nJSON.parse(json, T) and JSON.parse!(json, x) variants have been added for constructing a Julia value from JSON, or mutating an existing Julia value from JSON; JSON.parsefile(json, T) and JSON.parsefile!(json, x) are also supported; see JSON Reading for more details\nWhy the changes:\nThe inttype keyword argument is rare among other JSON libraries and doesn't serve a strong purpose; memory gains from possibly using smaller ints is minimal and leads to more error-prone code via overflows by trying to force integers into non-standard small types\nFor the allownan default value change, there are many benchmarks/JSON-accuracy checking test suites that enforce adherance to the specification; following the specification by default is recommended and common across language JSON libraries\nMmapping is an internal detail that most users shouldn't worry about anyway, and it can be done transparently without any outside affect to the user\nJSONText\nJSONText can now also be used while parsing, as a field type of a struct or directly to return the raw JSON (similar to how writing with JSONText works)","category":"page"},{"location":"migrate/#Migration-guide-for-JSON3.jl","page":"Migration guides","title":"Migration guide for JSON3.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"migrate/","page":"Migration guides","title":"Migration guides","text":"The JSON.jl 1.0 release incorporates many of the design ideas that were originally developed in JSON3.jl.

Its design is the direct result of wanting to provide roughly similar functionality as StructTypes.jl but avoiding the pitfalls and architectural complexities it had\nCustom Type Serialization\nWhat stayed the same:\nBoth provide a way to customize how types are serialized\nBoth support serializing custom types to any valid JSON value\nWhat changed:\nInterface: No need to declare StructTypes.StructType explicitly on structs (StructUtils.jl can detect the vast majority of struct types automatically)\nNon-owned types: JSON.jl (via StructUtils) provides the concept of defining a custom StructStyle subtype that allows customizing the lowering/lifting overloads of non-owned types (JSON3.jl had repeated requests/issues with users wanting more control over non-owned types without pirating)\nWhy the changes:\nAs noted above, the overall design of StructUtils is simpler and more automatic, with the default definitions working in the vast majority of cases. If you're the author of a custom Number, AbstractString, AbstractArray, or AbstractDict, you may need to dig further into StructUtil machinery to make your types serialize/deserialize as expected, but regular structs should \"just work\"\nDefining custom styles is meant to balance having to do some extra work (defining the style, passing it to JSON.json/JSON.parse) with the power and flexibility of control over how JSON serialization/deserialization work for any type, owned or not\nField Customization\nWhat stayed the same:\nBoth allow renaming fields, excluding fields, and some control over manipulating fields from JSON output (keyword args, dateformats, etc.)\nWhat changed:\nStructUtils provides convenient \"struct\" macros (@noarg, @kwarg, @tags, @defaults, @nonstruct) that allow defining default values for fields, and specifying \"field tags\" which are named tuples of properties for fields. Via field tags, fields can customize naming, ignoring/excluding, dateformating, custom lowering/lifting, and even \"type choosing\" for abstract types.\nWhy the changes:\nThe field tags and defaults of StructUtils provide very powerful and generalized abilities to specify properties for fields. These are integrated directly with the serialize/deserialize process of StructUtils and provide a seemless way to enhance and control fields as desired. Instead of providing numerous StructType overloads, we can annotate individual fields appropriately, keeping context and information tidy and close to the source.\nNull and Empty Value Handling\nWhat stayed the same:\nBoth allow control over including/omitting null values and empty collections\nWhat changed:\nControl mechanism: JSON3.jl uses StructTypes.omitempties, JSON.jl 1.0 uses keyword arguments omit_null and omit_empty; or struct-level overloads or annotations to control omission","category":"page"},{"location":"migrate/#Reading-JSON-2","page":"Migration guides","title":"Reading JSON","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"migrate/","page":"Migration guides","title":"Migration guides","text":"JSON3.read → JSON.parse / JSON.lazy\nWhat stayed the same:\nCore functionality of parsing JSON into Julia values\nSupport for typed parsing into custom structs\nLazy parsing features\nWhat changed:\nFunction names: JSON3.read becomes either JSON.parse (eager) or JSON.lazy (lazy)\nDefault container type: JSON3.Object/JSON3.Array becomes JSON.Object{String, Any}/Vector{Any}\nType integration: JSON3.jl uses StructTypes.jl, JSON.jl 1.0 uses StructUtils.jl\nLazy value access: Both use property access syntax (obj.field) but with slightly different semantics\nMigration examples:\n# JSON3.jl\nobj = JSON3.read(json_str)\ntyped_obj = JSON3.read(json_str, MyType)\n\n# JSON.jl 1.0\nobj = JSON.parse(json_str)               # eager parsing\nlazy_obj = JSON.lazy(json_str)           # lazy parsing\nmaterialized = lazy_obj[]                # materialize lazy value\ntyped_obj = JSON.parse(json_str, MyType) # typed parsing\nLazy Parsing\nWhat stayed the same:\nBoth support lazy parsing for efficient access to parts of large JSON documents\nBoth allow dot notation for accessing object fields\nWhat changed:\nObject types: JSON3.Object becomes JSON.LazyValue with object type\nArray indexing: Similar, but slight syntax differences for materializing values\nMaterialization: In JSON3.jl specific values materialize when accessed, in JSON.jl 1.0 you explicitly use [] to materialize\nMigration examples:\n# JSON3.jl\nobj = JSON3.read(json_str)\nvalue = obj.deeply.nested.field  # value is materialized\n\n# JSON.jl 1.0\nobj = JSON.lazy(json_str)\nlazy_value = obj.deeply.nested.field  # still lazy\nvalue = obj.deeply.nested.field[]     # now materialized\nWhy the changes:\nThe lazy support in JSON.jl is truly lazy and the underlying JSON is only parsed/navigated as explicitly requested. JSON3.jl still fully parsed the JSON into a fairly compact binary representation, avoiding full materialization of objects and arrays.\nTyped Parsing\nWhat stayed the same:\nBoth allow parsing directly into custom types\nBoth support object mapping, handling nested types, unions with Nothing/Missing\nWhat changed:\nInterface: StructTypes.StructType becomes JSON.jl's StructUtils integration\nDefault values: StructTypes.defaults becomes @defaults macro\nType selection: Custom JSON3 dispatching becomes JSON.@choosetype\nMigration examples:\n# JSON3.jl\nStructTypes.StructType(::Type{MyType}) = StructTypes.Struct()\nStructTypes.defaults(::Type{MyType}) = (field1=0, field2=\"default\")\n\n# Type selection in JSON3.jl\nStructTypes.StructType(::Type{AbstractParent}) = StructTypes.AbstractType()\nStructTypes.subtypes(::Type{AbstractParent}) = (a=ConcreteA, b=ConcreteB)\n\n# JSON.jl 1.0\n@defaults struct MyType\n    field1::Int = 0\n    field2::String = \"default\"\nend\n\n# Type selection in JSON.jl 1.0\nJSON.@choosetype AbstractParent x -> x.type[] == \"a\" ?

Iffalse`, the output will be written in the standard JSON format.\n\npretty::Union{Integer,Bool}=false: Controls pretty printing of the JSON output. If true, the output will be pretty-printed with 2 spaces of indentation. If an integer, it will be used as the number of spaces of indentation. If false or 0, the output will be compact. Note: Pretty printing is not supported when jsonlines=true.\ninline_limit::Int=0: For arrays shorter than this limit, pretty printing will be disabled (indentation set to 0).\nninf::String=\"-Infinity\": Custom string representation for negative infinity.\ninf::String=\"Infinity\": Custom string representation for positive infinity.\nnan::String=\"NaN\": Custom string representation for NaN.\nfloat_style::Symbol=:shortest: Controls how floating-point numbers are formatted.

When writing to IO, the buffer will be flushed  to the IO stream once it reaches this size. This helps control memory usage during large write operations. Default is 4MB (2^22 bytes). This parameter is ignored when returning a String.\nstyle::JSONStyle=JSONWriteStyle(): Custom style object that controls serialization behavior. This allows customizing   certain aspects of serialization, like defining a custom lower method for a non-owned type. Like struct MyStyle <: JSONStyle end,   JSON.lower(x::Rational) = (num=x.num, den=x.den), then calling JSON.json(1//3; style=MyStyle()) will output   {\"num\": 1, \"den\": 3}.\n\nBy default, x must be a JSON-serializable object. Supported types include:\n\nAbstractString => JSON string: types must support the AbstractString interface, specifically with support for ncodeunits and codeunit(x, i).\nBool => JSON boolean: must be true or false\nNothing => JSON null: must be the nothing singleton value\nNumber => JSON number: Integer subtypes or Union{Float16, Float32, Float64} have default implementations for other Number types, JSON.tostring is first called to convert the value to a String before being written directly to JSON output\nAbstractArray/Tuple/AbstractSet => JSON array: objects for which JSON.arraylike returns true  are output as JSON arrays. arraylike is defined by default for AbstractArray, AbstractSet, Tuple, and Base.Generator. For other types that define, they must also properly implement StructUtils.applyeach to iterate over the index => elements pairs. Note that arrays with dimensionality > 1 are written as nested arrays, with N nestings for N dimensions, and the 1st dimension is always the innermost nested JSON array (column-major order).\nAbstractDict/NamedTuple/structs => JSON object: if a value doesn't fall into any of the above categories, it is output as a JSON object. StructUtils.applyeach is called, which has appropriate implementations for AbstractDict, NamedTuple, and structs, where field names => values are iterated over. Field names can be output with an alternative name via field tag overload, like field::Type &(json=(name=\"alternative_name\",),)\n\nIf an object is not JSON-serializable, an override for JSON.lower can be defined to convert it to a JSON-serializable object. Some default lower defintions are defined in JSON itself, for example:\n\nStructUtils.lower(::Missing) = nothing\nStructUtils.lower(x::Symbol) = String(x)\nStructUtils.lower(x::Union{Enum, AbstractChar, VersionNumber, Cstring, Cwstring, UUID, Dates.TimeType}) = string(x)\nStructUtils.lower(x::Regex) = x.pattern\n\nThese allow common Base/stdlib types to be serialized in an expected format.\n\nCircular references are tracked automatically and cycles are broken by writing null for any children references.\n\nFor pre-formatted JSON data as a String, use JSONText(json) to write the string out as-is.\n\nFor AbstractDict objects with non-string keys, StructUtils.lowerkey will be called before serializing. This allows aggregate or other types of dict keys to be converted to an appropriate string representation. See StructUtils.liftkey for the reverse operation, which is called when parsing JSON data back into a dict type.\n\nNOTE: JSON.json should not be overloaded directly by custom types as this isn't robust for various output options (IO, String, etc.) nor recursive situations. Types should define an appropriate JSON.lower definition instead.\n\nNOTE: JSON.json(str, indent::Integer) is special-cased for backwards compatibility with pre-1.0 JSON.jl, as this typically would mean \"write out the indent integer to file str\". As writing out a single integer to a file is extremely rare, it was decided to keep the pre-1.0 behavior for compatibility reasons.\n\nExamples:\n\nusing Dates\n\nabstract type AbstractMonster end\n\nstruct Dracula <: AbstractMonster\n    num_victims::Int\nend\n\nstruct Werewolf <: AbstractMonster\n    witching_hour::DateTime\nend\n\nstruct Percent <: Number\n    value::Float64\nend\n\nJSON.lower(x::Percent) = x.value\nStructUtils.lowerkey(x::Percent) = string(x.value)\n\n@noarg mutable struct FrankenStruct\n    id::Int\n    name::String # no default to show serialization of an undefined field\n    address::Union{Nothing, String} = nothing\n    rate::Union{Missing, Float64} = missing\n    type::Symbol = :a &(json=(name=\"franken_type\",),)\n    notsure::Any = JSON.Object(\"key\" => \"value\")\n    monster::AbstractMonster = Dracula(10) &(json=(lower=x -> x isa Dracula ?

It has a lower field tag that specifies how the value of this field specifically (not all AbstractMonster) should be serialized\nThe percent field is a Percent, which is a custom type. It has a lower method that specifies how Percent values should be serialized\nThe birthdate field has a dateformat field tag, so the value follows the format (yyyy/mm/dd) instead of the default date ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd)\nThe percentages field is a Dict{Percent, Int}, which is a custom type. It has a lowerkey method that specifies how Percent keys should be serialized as strings\nThe json_properties field is a JSONText, so the JSONText value is serialized as-is\nThe matrix field is a Matrix{Float64}, which is a custom type. It is serialized as a JSON array, with the first dimension being the innermost nested JSON array (column-major order)\nThe extra_field field has a ignore field tag, so it is skipped when serializing\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"reference/#JSON.lazy","page":"API Reference","title":"JSON.lazy","text":"JSON.lazy(json; kw...)\nJSON.lazyfile(file; kw...)\n\nDetect the initial JSON value in json, returning a JSON.LazyValue instance. json input can be:\n\nAbstractString\nAbstractVector{UInt8}\nIO, IOStream, Cmd (bytes are fully read into a Vector{UInt8} for parsing, i.e. read(json) is called)\n\nlazyfile is a convenience method that takes a filename and opens the file before calling lazy.\n\nThe JSON.LazyValue supports the \"selection\" syntax for lazily navigating the JSON value. For example (x = JSON.lazy(json)):\n\nx.key, x[:key] or x[\"key\"] for JSON objects\nx[1], x[2:3], x[end] for JSON arrays\npropertynames(x) to see all keys in the JSON object\nx.a.b.c for selecting deeply nested values\nx[~, (k, v) -> k == \"foo\"] for recursively searching for key \"foo\" and return matching values\n\nNOTE: Selecting values from a LazyValue will always return a LazyValue. Selecting a specific key of an object or index of an array will only parse what is necessary before returning. This leads to a few conclusions about how to effectively utilize LazyValue:\n\nJSON.lazy is great for one-time access of a value in JSON\nIt's also great for finding a required deeply nested value\nIt's not great for any case where repeated access to values is required; this results in the same JSON being parsed on each access (i.e. naively iterating a lazy JSON array will be O(n^2))\nBest practice is to use JSON.lazy sparingly unless there's a specific case where it will benefit; or use JSON.lazy as a means to access a value that is then fully materialized\n\nAnother option for processing JSON.LazyValue is calling foreach(f, x) which is defined on JSON.LazyValue for JSON objects and arrays. For objects, f should be of the form f(kv::Pair{String, LazyValue}) where kv is a key-value pair, and for arrays, f(v::LazyValue) where v is the value at the index. This allows for iterating over all key-value pairs in an object or all values in an array without materializing the entire structure.\n\nLazy values can be materialized via JSON.parse in a few different forms:\n\nJSON.parse(json): Default materialization into JSON.Object (a Dict-like type), Vector{Any}, etc.\nJSON.parse(json, T): Materialize into a user-provided type T (following rules/programmatic construction from StructUtils.jl)\nJSON.parse!(json, x): Materialize into an existing object x (following rules/programmatic construction from StructUtils.jl)\n\nThus for completeness sake, here's an example of ideal usage of JSON.lazy:\n\nx = JSON.lazy(very_large_json_object)\n# find a deeply nested value\ny = x.a.b.c.d.e.f.g\n# materialize the value\nz = JSON.parse(y)\n# now mutate/repeatedly access values in z\n\nIn this example, we only parsed as much of the very_large_json_object as was required to find the value y. Then we fully materialized y into z, which is now a normal Julia object. We can now mutate or access values in z.\n\nCurrently supported keyword arguments include:\n\nallownan::Bool = false: whether \"special\" float values shoudl be allowed while parsing (NaN, Inf, -Inf); these values are specifically not allowed in the JSON spec, but many JSON libraries allow reading/writing\nninf::String = \"-Infinity\": the string that will be used to parse -Inf if allownan=true\ninf::String = \"Infinity\": the string that will be used to parse Inf if allownan=true\nnan::String = \"NaN\": the string that will be sued to parse NaN if allownan=true\njsonlines::Bool = false: whether the JSON input should be treated as an implicit array, with newlines separating individual JSON elements with no leading '[' or trailing ']' characters.

For example (x = JSON.lazy(json)):\n\nx.key, x[:key] or x[\"key\"] for JSON objects\nx[1], x[2:3], x[end] for JSON arrays\npropertynames(x) to see all keys in the JSON object\nx.a.b.c for selecting deeply nested values\nx[~, (k, v) -> k == \"foo\"] for recursively searching for key \"foo\" and return matching values\n\nNOTE: Selecting values from a LazyValue will always return a LazyValue. Selecting a specific key of an object or index of an array will only parse what is necessary before returning. This leads to a few conclusions about how to effectively utilize LazyValue:\n\nJSON.lazy is great for one-time access of a value in JSON\nIt's also great for finding a required deeply nested value\nIt's not great for any case where repeated access to values is required; this results in the same JSON being parsed on each access (i.e. naively iterating a lazy JSON array will be O(n^2))\nBest practice is to use JSON.lazy sparingly unless there's a specific case where it will benefit; or use JSON.lazy as a means to access a value that is then fully materialized\n\nAnother option for processing JSON.LazyValue is calling foreach(f, x) which is defined on JSON.LazyValue for JSON objects and arrays. For objects, f should be of the form f(kv::Pair{String, LazyValue}) where kv is a key-value pair, and for arrays, f(v::LazyValue) where v is the value at the index. This allows for iterating over all key-value pairs in an object or all values in an array without materializing the entire structure.\n\nLazy values can be materialized via JSON.parse in a few different forms:\n\nJSON.parse(json): Default materialization into JSON.Object (a Dict-like type), Vector{Any}, etc.\nJSON.parse(json, T): Materialize into a user-provided type T (following rules/programmatic construction from StructUtils.jl)\nJSON.parse!(json, x): Materialize into an existing object x (following rules/programmatic construction from StructUtils.jl)\n\nThus for completeness sake, here's an example of ideal usage of JSON.lazy:\n\nx = JSON.lazy(very_large_json_object)\n# find a deeply nested value\ny = x.a.b.c.d.e.f.g\n# materialize the value\nz = JSON.parse(y)\n# now mutate/repeatedly access values in z\n\nIn this example, we only parsed as much of the very_large_json_object as was required to find the value y.

This allows overriding default behaviors for non-owned types.\n\nThe methods without a type specified (JSON.parse(json), JSON.parsefile(filename)), do a generic materialization into predefined default types, including:\n\nJSON object => JSON.Object{String, Any} (see note below)\nJSON array => Vector{Any}\nJSON string => String\nJSON number => Int64, BigInt, Float64, or BigFloat\nJSON true => true\nJSON false => false\nJSON null => nothing\n\nWhen a type T is specified (JSON.parse(json, T), JSON.parsefile(filename, T)), materialization to a value of type T will be attempted utilizing machinery and interfaces provided by the StructUtils.jl package, including:\n\nFor JSON objects, JSON keys will be matched against field names of T with a value being constructed via T(args...)\nIf T was defined with the @noarg macro, an empty instance will be constructed, and field values set as JSON keys match field names\nIf T had default field values defined using the @defaults or @kwarg macros (from StructUtils.jl package), those will be set in the value of T unless different values are parsed from the JSON\nIf T was defined with the @nonstruct macro, the struct will be treated as a primitive type and constructed using the lift function rather than from field values\nJSON keys that don't match field names in T will be ignored (skipped over)\nIf a field in T has a name fieldtag, the name value will be used to match JSON keys instead\nIf T or any recursive field type of T is abstract, an appropriate JSON.@choosetype T x -> ... definition should exist for \"choosing\" a concrete type at runtime; default type choosing exists for Union{T, Missing} and Union{T, Nothing} where the JSON value is checked if null. If the Any type is encountered, the default materialization types will be used (JSON.Object, Vector{Any}, etc.)\nFor any non-JSON-standard non-aggregate (i.e. non-object, non-array) field type of T, a JSON.lift(::Type{T}, x) = ... definition can be defined for how to \"lift\" the default JSON value (String, Number, Bool, nothing) to the type T; a default lift definition exists, for example, for JSON.lift(::Type{Missing}, x) = missing where the standard JSON value for null is nothing and it can be \"lifted\" to missing\nFor any T or recursive field type of T that is AbstractDict, non-string/symbol/integer keys will need to have a StructUtils.liftkey(::Type{T}, x)) definition for how to \"lift\" the JSON string key to the key type of T\n\nFor any T or recursive field type of T that is JSON.JSONText, the next full raw JSON value will be preserved in the JSONText wrapper as-is.\n\nFor the unique case of nested JSON arrays and prior knowledge of the expected dimensionality, a target type T can be given as an AbstractArray{T, N} subtype. In this case, the JSON array data is materialized as an n-dimensional array, where: the number of JSON array nestings must match the Julia array dimensionality (N), nested JSON arrays at matching depths are assumed to have equal lengths, and the length of the innermost JSON array is the 1st dimension length and so on. For example, the JSON array [[[1.0,2.0]]] would be materialized as a 3-dimensional array of Float64 with sizes (2, 1, 1), when called like JSON.parse(\"[[[1.0,2.0]]]\", Array{Float64, 3}). Note that n-dimensional Julia arrays are written to json as nested JSON arrays by default, to enable lossless re-parsing, though the dimensionality must still be provided explicitly to the call to parse (i.e. default parsing via JSON.parse(json) will result in plain nested Vector{Any}s returned).\n\nExamples:\n\nusing Dates\n\nabstract type AbstractMonster end\n\nstruct Dracula <: AbstractMonster\n    num_victims::Int\nend\n\nstruct Werewolf <: AbstractMonster\n    witching_hour::DateTime\nend\n\nJSON.@choosetype AbstractMonster x -> x.monster_type[] == \"vampire\" ?

A default lift definition for Symbol is used to convert the JSON string value to a Symbol.\nThe notsure field is of type Any, so the default object type JSON.Object{String, Any} is used to materialize the JSON value.\nThe monster field is a polymorphic type, and the JSON value has a monster_type key that determines which concrete type to use. The @choosetype macro is used to define the logic for choosing the concrete type based on the JSON input. Note that teh x in @choosetype is a LazyValue, so we materialize via x.monster_type[] in order to compare with the string \"vampire\".\nThe percent field is a custom type Percent and the JSON.lift defines how to construct a Percent from the JSON value, which is a Float64 in this case.\nThe birthdate field uses a custom date format for parsing, specified in the JSON input.\nThe percentages field is a dictionary with keys of type Percent, which is a custom type. The liftkey function is defined to convert the JSON string keys to Percent types (parses the Float64 manually)\nThe json_properties field has a type of JSONText, which means the raw JSON will be preserved as a String of the JSONText type.\nThe matrix field is a Matrix{Float64}, so the JSON input array-of-arrays are materialized as such.\nThe extra_key field is not defined in the FrankenStruct type, so it is ignored and skipped over.\n\nNOTE: Why use JSON.Object{String, Any} as the default object type? It provides several benefits:\n\nBehaves as a drop-in replacement for Dict{String, Any}, so no loss of functionality\nPerformance! It's internal representation means memory savings and faster construction for small objects typical in JSON (vs Dict)\nInsertion order is preserved, so the order of keys in the JSON input is preserved in JSON.Object\nConvenient getproperty (i.e. obj.key) syntax is supported, even for Object{String,Any} key types (again ideal/specialized for JSON usage)\n\nJSON.Object internal representation uses a linked list, thus key lookups are linear time (O(n)). For large JSON objects, (hundreds or thousands of keys), consider using a Dict{String, Any} instead, like JSON.parse(json; dicttype=Dict{String, Any}).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"reference/#JSON.print","page":"API Reference","title":"JSON.print","text":"JSON.json(x) -> String\nJSON.json(io, x)\nJSON.json(file_name, x)\n\nSerialize x to JSON format. The 1st method takes just the object and returns a String. In the 2nd method, io is an IO object, and the JSON output will be written to it. For the 3rd method, file_name is a String, a file will be opened and the JSON output will be written to it.\n\nAll methods accept the following keyword arguments:\n\nomit_null::Union{Bool, Nothing}=nothing: Controls whether struct fields that are undefined or are nothing are included in the JSON output. If true, only non-null fields are written. If false, all fields are included regardless of being undefined or nothing. If nothing, the behavior is determined by JSON.omit_null(::Type{T}), which is false by default.\nomit_empty::Union{Bool, Nothing}=nothing: Controls whether struct fields that are empty are included in the JSON output. If true, empty fields are excluded. If false, empty fields are included. If nothing, the behavior is determined by JSON.omit_empty(::Type{T}).\nallownan::Bool=false: If true, allow Inf, -Inf, and NaN in the output. If false, throw an error if Inf, -Inf, or NaN is encountered.\njsonlines::Bool=false: If true, input must be array-like and the output will be written in the JSON Lines format, where each element of the array is written on a separate line (i.e. separated by a single newline character `\n\n).   Iffalse`, the output will be written in the standard JSON format.\n\npretty::Union{Integer,Bool}=false: Controls pretty printing of the JSON output. If true, the output will be pretty-printed with 2 spaces of indentation. If an integer, it will be used as the number of spaces of indentation. If false or 0, the output will be compact. Note: Pretty printing is not supported when jsonlines=true.\ninline_limit::Int=0: For arrays shorter than this limit, pretty printing will be disabled (indentation set to 0).\nninf::String=\"-Infinity\": Custom string representation for negative infinity.\ninf::String=\"Infinity\": Custom string representation for positive infinity.\nnan::String=\"NaN\": Custom string representation for NaN.\nfloat_style::Symbol=:shortest: Controls how floating-point numbers are formatted. Options are:\n:shortest: Use the shortest representation that preserves the value\n:fixed: Use fixed-point notation\n:exp: Use exponential notation\nfloat_precision::Int=1: Number of decimal places to use when float_style is :fixed or :exp.\nbufsize::Int=2^22: Buffer size in bytes for IO operations. When writing to IO, the buffer will be flushed  to the IO stream once it reaches this size. This helps control memory usage during large write operations. Default is 4MB (2^22 bytes). This parameter is ignored when returning a String.\nstyle::JSONStyle=JSONWriteStyle(): Custom style object that controls serialization behavior. This allows customizing   certain aspects of serialization, like defining a custom lower method for a non-owned type. Like struct MyStyle <: JSONStyle end,   JSON.lower(x::Rational) = (num=x.num, den=x.den), then calling JSON.json(1//3; style=MyStyle()) will output   {\"num\": 1, \"den\": 3}.\n\nBy default, x must be a JSON-serializable object. Supported types include:\n\nAbstractString => JSON string: types must support the AbstractString interface, specifically with support for ncodeunits and codeunit(x, i).\nBool => JSON boolean: must be true or false\nNothing => JSON null: must be the nothing singleton value\nNumber => JSON number: Integer subtypes or Union{Float16, Float32, Float64} have default implementations for other Number types, JSON.tostring is first called to convert the value to a String before being written directly to JSON output\nAbstractArray/Tuple/AbstractSet => JSON array: objects for which JSON.arraylike returns true  are output as JSON arrays. arraylike is defined by default for AbstractArray, AbstractSet, Tuple, and Base.Generator. For other types that define, they must also properly implement StructUtils.applyeach to iterate over the index => elements pairs. Note that arrays with dimensionality > 1 are written as nested arrays, with N nestings for N dimensions, and the 1st dimension is always the innermost nested JSON array (column-major order).\nAbstractDict/NamedTuple/structs => JSON object: if a value doesn't fall into any of the above categories, it is output as a JSON object. StructUtils.applyeach is called, which has appropriate implementations for AbstractDict, NamedTuple, and structs, where field names => values are iterated over. Field names can be output with an alternative name via field tag overload, like field::Type &(json=(name=\"alternative_name\",),)\n\nIf an object is not JSON-serializable, an override for JSON.lower can be defined to convert it to a JSON-serializable object. Some default lower defintions are defined in JSON itself, for example:\n\nStructUtils.lower(::Missing) = nothing\nStructUtils.lower(x::Symbol) = String(x)\nStructUtils.lower(x::Union{Enum, AbstractChar, VersionNumber, Cstring, Cwstring, UUID, Dates.TimeType}) = string(x)\nStructUtils.lower(x::Regex) = x.pattern\n\nThese allow common Base/stdlib types to be serialized in an expected format.\n\nCircular references are tracked automatically and cycles are broken by writing null for any children references.\n\nFor pre-formatted JSON data as a String, use JSONText(json) to write the string out as-is.\n\nFor AbstractDict objects with non-string keys, StructUtils.lowerkey will be called before serializing. This allows aggregate or other types of dict keys to be converted to an appropriate string representation. See StructUtils.liftkey for the reverse operation, which is called when parsing JSON data back into a dict type.\n\nNOTE: JSON.json should not be overloaded directly by custom types as this isn't robust for various output options (IO, String, etc.) nor recursive situations. Types should define an appropriate JSON.lower definition instead.\n\nNOTE: JSON.json(str, indent::Integer) is special-cased for backwards compatibility with pre-1.0 JSON.jl, as this typically would mean \"write out the indent integer to file str\". As writing out a single integer to a file is extremely rare, it was decided to keep the pre-1.0 behavior for compatibility reasons.\n\nExamples:\n\nusing Dates\n\nabstract type AbstractMonster end\n\nstruct Dracula <: AbstractMonster\n    num_victims::Int\nend\n\nstruct Werewolf <: AbstractMonster\n    witching_hour::DateTime\nend\n\nstruct Percent <: Number\n    value::Float64\nend\n\nJSON.lower(x::Percent) = x.value\nStructUtils.lowerkey(x::Percent) = string(x.value)\n\n@noarg mutable struct FrankenStruct\n    id::Int\n    name::String # no default to show serialization of an undefined field\n    address::Union{Nothing, String} = nothing\n    rate::Union{Missing, Float64} = missing\n    type::Symbol = :a &(json=(name=\"franken_type\",),)\n    notsure::Any = JSON.Object(\"key\" => \"value\")\n    monster::AbstractMonster = Dracula(10) &(json=(lower=x -> x isa Dracula ?

It has a lower field tag that specifies how the value of this field specifically (not all AbstractMonster) should be serialized\nThe percent field is a Percent, which is a custom type. It has a lower method that specifies how Percent values should be serialized\nThe birthdate field has a dateformat field tag, so the value follows the format (yyyy/mm/dd) instead of the default date ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd)\nThe percentages field is a Dict{Percent, Int}, which is a custom type. It has a lowerkey method that specifies how Percent keys should be serialized as strings\nThe json_properties field is a JSONText, so the JSONText value is serialized as-is\nThe matrix field is a Matrix{Float64}, which is a custom type.

For x.g.h.i, this deeply nested access of the \"foo\" value, is a chain of getproperty calls, with each call (i.e. y = x.g, then z = y.h, etc.) returning a LazyValue of where the next nested object begins in the raw JSON. With the final getproperty call (h.i), a non-object LazyValue(\"foo\") is returned. In our raw JSON, the \"foo\" value is located near the end, so we can infer that by doing x.g.h.i, the underlying JSON was parsed or navigated until the i key was found and its value returned. In this example, \"foo\" is indeed the last value in our raw JSON, but in the example of x.c, we can also be assured that only as much JSON as necessary was parsed/navigated before returning LazyValue(true). In this way, the various syntax calls (getproperty, getindex, etc.) on LazyValues can be thought of as purely navigational as opposed to anything related to materialization.
